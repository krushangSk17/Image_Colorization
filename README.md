# AI_Project On Grey Image colorization
Image colorization using CNN 
	Main objective of image colorization is converted grey scale image (black and white) to colour image using CNN.

	Colorization is the process of colouring monochrome images. It has been widely used in photo processing and scientific illustration.  

	We have proposed a way to effectively colorize images with significantly reduced amount of user efforts.
